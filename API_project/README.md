# API Mini Project
****
### Introduction
In this exercise we will be pulling some data from the Quandl API. Qaundl is currently the most widely used aggregator of financial market data.

We will focus on equities data from the Frankfurt Stock Exhange (FSE), which is available for free. We'll try and analyze the stock prices of a company called Carl Zeiss Meditec, which manufactures tools for eye examinations, as well as medical lasers for laser eye surgery. The company is listed under the stock ticker AFX_X.

Note: we will only be using the Python standard library along with requests, json and numpy

**You must have your own API key to run the script**
