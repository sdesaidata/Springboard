# What is the True Normal Human Body Temperature?

The mean normal body temperature was held to be 37 degrees C or 98.6 degrees F for more than 120 years since it was first conceptualized and reported by Carl Wunderlich in a famous 1868 book. But, is this value statistically correct? In this exercise, we will analyze a dataset of human body temperatures and employ the concepts of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance in order to answer the following questions:

Is the distribution of body temperatures normal?

Is the sample size large? Are the observations independent?

Is the true population mean really 98.6 degrees F?

Draw a small sample of size 10 from the data and repeat both frequentist tests.

At what temperature should we consider someone's temperature to be "abnormal"?

Is there a significant difference between males and females in normal temperature?
