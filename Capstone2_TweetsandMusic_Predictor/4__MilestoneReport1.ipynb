    "# Capstone 2 Milestone Report: Predicting Music Genre from User Tweets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Social media can tell you lots of information about a person or individual that you might not even know you can find out. My focus will be specifically on Twitter and tweets. From a user’s profile you can gain a lot of insight on what they like to do, what they are interested in, and much more from the information they tweet, retweet and the people they follow. How can this information be quantified at some level and how can it be leveraged to be used in a business setting?\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ve always enjoyed listening to music and have found it a common talking point amongst others. It is always around whether its a Spotify playlist, or background music at your favorite coffee shop. I mentioned that you can gain a lot of insight by looking at an individual user and their tendencies, but is it possible to find trends and talking points amongst people who have similar musical interests? I aim to use Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning models to correctly classify users who have self identified themselves into liking a specific genre of music in their Twitter bios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "With the growing use of technology, the landscape of advertising is changing significantly. Ads can be tailored to individuals based on their interests allowing for more relevant information to appear for users, as well as companies being able to spread their product effectively. By determining common diction and similarities in text by users who prefer the same genre of music, this model can be expanded to search through users who have not labeled their musical preferences to continue to improve their ad experience while using social media and other platforms of the web. I plan to use advanced NLP techniques such as name recognition and LDA to create a solution for this problem.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Data Acquisition:\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin my project I need to acquire the tweets of individuals. I focused on five genres of music:\n",
    "+ Hip Hop\n",
    "+ Country\n",
    "+ Jazz\n",
    "+ Metal\n",
    "+ Electronic Dance Music (EDM)\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify users of each genre of music I used FollowerWonk. FollowerWonk allowed me to search the bio of twitter users for key words that may identify them as a enthusiast of a specific genre of music. You can see below the tags I used to identify twitter users for each genre. In total I found 200 users per genre summing to a grand total of 1000.\n",
    "+ Hip Hop --- \"hip hop head\", \"hip hop fan\"\n",
    "+ Country --- \"country music fan\", \"country music lover\"\n",
    "+ Jazz ------ \"jazz enthusiast\", \"jazz lover\"\n",
    "+ Metal ----- \"metal head\", \"metalhead\"\n",
    "+ EDM ------- \"edm fan\", \"edm junkie\", \"edm lover\", \"edm enthusiast\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Next came the task to scrape data from each user. My goal was to scrape 40 tweets from each user, avoiding any tweets that had any links associated with them. Using the Twitter API, you have to login to a twitter account and also take into account for rate limitations as well as the number of tweets you can scrape from a user. To tackle this issue I was able to find an advanced Twitter scraping tool built in python, the Twitter Intelligence Tool, TWINT for short. With a quick inital setup I was able to pull 40,000 tweets in under an hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this portion of my project can be found on my github under 1__ScrapeTweets. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Wrangling \n",
    "\n",
    "Music is differentiated by artists, slang, songs, albums, etc. that can make it very easy to identify what type of music that a user enjoys listening to. For this reason, I want to remove any tweets associated or related to music and focus on the tweets left behind. In addition I want to avoid tweets with only emojis, or only one of two words. \n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this task, I had to use beginner and advanced NLP techniques using spaCy, an open source library for Natural Language Processing. More specifically I had to use the technique known as semantic similarity. I go more into this later in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal was to remove any tweets related to music but that can be very tricky.\n",
    "1. Looking through 40,000 tweets would be very time consuming.\n",
    "2. I may miss a term within a genre that I am unfamiliar with. For example, Kanye West can be seen referred as Kanye, Yeezus, Ye, Kanye West, etc. \n",
    "3. Building on this even more, an album name can have words that are not correlated to music in any way. Building off the Kanye example, his new album is called \"Jesus is King\", none of which are words related to music.\n",
    "\n",
    "To attempt to tackle this I decided to use semantic similarity. Using the algorithm word2vec and spaCy's prebuilt word embeddings, I looked at the similarity of a tweet to the three words, \"music\", \"album\" and \"song\". From here if the similarity was higher than 0.5 I removed the entire tweet from the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I removed any tweets that were not in English using lang detect leaving my total number of tweets across the five music genres to be 6,660. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this portion of my project can be found on my github under 2__DataWrangle. \n",

    "\n",
    "Looking at this comparison between the various genres, there doesn't really appear to be any words or associations that jump out from one another. However there are some interesting tidbits such as \"trump\" being most mentioned among EDM listeners while least predictive among Jazz listeners. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the nature of Twitter being only 140 characters at the time that I had pulled this data, it may be that due to the limitaiton in length, there is a lot more similarity among users when not mentoining music in specific.\n",

    "|------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n",
    "| Country    | pray, you, male                       | blush, hearts, tongue out winking |\n",

    "\n",
    "With the new emoji library, diversifying emojis to include racial diversity there are a lot more options for individuals to use, yet you can see lots of similarities among twitter users. Emojis such as the fire emoji, heart, 100 and pray are seen frequently in tweets across users. However you can see distinct differences among users. For example Hip Hop users showed more usage of heart emojis in general compared to their counterparts.\n",

    "__Word Frequency Counts and Word Clouds:__\n",
    "To add a splash of visualization I decided to create some Word Clouds as well as counting word frequencies based on the lemmatized text. However again, it seems that when removing originality portions of a person's tweets left behind very similar words that were used frequently. Some of these words were \"go\", \"get\", \"like\", \"people\", \"say\", etc.\n",

    "## WRAP IT UP\n",
    "Overall the process to acquire and clean the data took a lot of creativity and innovative thinking. However, from this process of removing tweets that a person identified with most based off of their Twitter biography, it left very general and similar tweets across listeners of different Genres. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see with what was left post data processing and analysis can be used to create a model that can predict what type of music an individual listens to. "
