    "The dataset we have contains over 1.5 million reviews of various beers from two websites: BeerAdvocate.com. This data not only includes user reviews, product category and alcohol by volume(ABV), but sensory aspects as well such as taste, look, smell and overall ratings. For this project we will train and test models to predict beer ratings and beer style based of the user reviews that were left.\n",
    "\n",
    "These reviews were made available by Julian Mcauley, a UCSD Computer Science professor, from a collection period of January 1998 to November 2011. This dataset was accessed with permssion. Here are some key specs of the dataset itself.\n",
