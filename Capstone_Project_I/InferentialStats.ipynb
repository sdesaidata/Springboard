    "# Predicting Beer Ratings from User Reviews: Inferential Statistics\n",
    "******\n",
    "\n",
    "The cleaned dataset for this capstone consists of 27 beer styles and 81408 reviews in total. Along with looking at the dataset as a whole I also examined five styles of beers based on beer distinction and size of the dataset. When summarizing my statistics I will discuss the word frequencies since they will be the main feature of this model and the word_count. I will talk about the dataset as a whole and then break it down into the five different styles as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were not too many features within this dataset. By determining the length of each review I created a quantitative feature for word_count. There are also 4 categorical features given by each user to rate the 'appearance', 'taste', 'feel' and 'aroma' of the beer along with an average of these four known as 'overall'.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part the majority of reviews given across all scales fall as either a 3-star or 4-star reviews. There are very few to no 1,2 and 5 star reviews. Again when further examining some styles of beers, this pattern reflects across all styles of beers. "

    "Examining the top 25 words I found that describing words such as 'sweet', 'light' and 'white' were used frequently. I also saw words such as 'aroma', 'flavor' and 'taste' which correspond to the different rating scales. The most common word was 'head' in reference to the foam at the top of the beer when it is first poured. This may need to be removed later on when running models.\n",

    "To explore the data further I also looked into the word count per review. This data was skewed to the right. The majority of reviews were less than 200 words but there were a few exceptions of very lengthy reviews. To see if the data was normal, I took the log and transformed the data. This indeed showed a much normal plot in comparison to the word_count.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the majority of reviews were 3 and 4 star reviews, I decided to create a low and high category for reviews using the overall rating scale. 3.5 was the middle marker. To see if there was an significant difference between these two categories I used a two sample t-test to determine this.\n",

    "Results showed that there is indeed a significant difference for word counts between low and high reviews. Reviews with an overall rating of 3.5 or greater have higher word counts than their counterparts. \n",

    "+ There are positive words such as 'nice' and 'good'. One word seen frequently, 'not', may need to be addressed when creating models. Bigrams may be necessary in case it changes the polarity of the sentence.\n",
    "+ Higher rated reviews (>3.5) have higher word counts than lower rated reviews for the entire dataset and the five beer styles examined. Speaking statistically, stouts were not as strong with a p-value of 0.16.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving onto creating models, the words, n-grams and separation of star ratings will be important factors to creating a successful model. Also narrowing down a model to a specific style of beer may make it easier to create a strong predictor model for the rating of a beer."
