    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

Based off the samples analyzed above it appears that the likelihood of a resume with a white sounding name getting a callback is roughly 50% higher than their black counterpart.  It has been proven that the proportion of callbacks for white sounding names is significantly higher than the proportion of callbacks for black sounding names. We are 95% confident that the different in rate of callbacks between the two groups is approximately between 1.7% and 4.7%.\n",

However, we cannot say for certain that this is the most important factor in callback success. There are other variables that have to be taken into account that we did not analyze from the dataset. Similar to what we did for race and callback rate, we must perform tests to determine which one is the most important factor. In addition to testing for significance we'd want to see if there is any correlation between different variables. "
